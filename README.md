### [Project Description](doc/)
Term: Spring 2017

+ Project title: Analyzing the Words of Presidents
+ This project is conducted by Galen Simmons

+ Project summary: I was interested in looking at the most common themes across different presidents.  What I found is that there is not a substantial difference in themes between Republican and Democratic presidents as shown by bigram counts.  I also compared three modern presidents (Obama, Clinton, and Trump), measuring the Pearson product-moment correlation.  This showed that the inaugural speech of Clinton was slightly more correlated to Obama than Trump's speech was to Obama.  I was also interested in how Presidents speak about the future, and I looked at sentiment preceding terms indicating a future sentiment (such as "shall", "ever", "never", and "will").  Lastly, I was curious whether Presidents had mentioned any foreign countries in their speeches.  I found that there are several countries than have been mentioned, but that even many large and notable countries have never been mentioned.
